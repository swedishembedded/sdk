 * This example shows how to execute an LQI controller within the context of
 * firmware, which communicates over a socket with a simulation connected to the
 * emulator.
 *
 * It is intentionally kept very raw and without dependencies because it is
 * intended to illustrate the core concept.
 *
 * We are writing to a raw memory location which is mapped by the simulator and
 * the data we write to it is passed to an external process. We can then read
 * data back and this data is also retrieved from an external process. Thus we
 * have a simulated plant that this controller stabilizes.
