Overview
********

The main custom board is based on Nucleo F401RE board.

It has all of the features of the original Nucleo F401RE board, with the added
possibility to simulate this board and debug it in simulation.

For more details about this board, visit `Nucleo F401RE website`_.

This board was the first board to be added to the SDK and so it is a bit of a
"demo" board. Many examples build for this board and the main testbench is based
on this board.
